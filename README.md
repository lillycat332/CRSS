# CRSS

Cascading Racketeering Style Sheets

CRSS is a Racket library for expressing CSS in pure Racket code.

The aim of CRSS is to provide a neat way to express CSS rules in Racket - it is not intended to be a full CSS implementation, and it is not intended to be a replacement for CSS.

The main goals of CRSS are:

- Generating clean, readable CSS
- Providing a way to express CSS rules in Racket code
- Allowing use of any Racket feature to dynamically generate CSS rules.
- Fast compilation to CSS
